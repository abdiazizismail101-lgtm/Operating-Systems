# Week 2: Linux Command Line and System Exploration

## Objective
The objective of Week 2 was to gain familiarity with the Linux command-line interface and to explore basic system information and filesystem structure on the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.

---

## Accessing the Server
The Ubuntu Server virtual machine installed in Week 1 was accessed via the local console using the configured `student` user account. Successful login confirmed that the system was operational and ready for command-line interaction.

---

## Linux Filesystem Exploration
Basic Linux commands were used to navigate and inspect the filesystem:

- `pwd` was used to display the current working directory.
- `ls` was used to list directory contents.
- `cd` was used to navigate between directories.

The standard Linux directory structure such as `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, and `/usr` was explored to understand their purpose within the operating system.

---

## System Information Commands
Several commands were executed to retrieve system information:

- `uname -a` was used to display kernel and system architecture information.
- `df -h` was used to view disk usage and mounted filesystems.
- `free -h` was used to display memory and swap usage.
- `whoami` was used to confirm the currently logged-in user.

## Screenshots
Screenshots were captured to provide evidence of command execution and system output. These screenshots are stored in the `screenshots` directory for this week.

## Reflection
This week provided essential hands-on experience with Linux command-line navigation and system inspection. These skills form a foundation for more advanced system administration tasks in later weeks of the Operating Systems coursework.
