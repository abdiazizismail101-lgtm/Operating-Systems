# Week 2: Linux Command Line and System Exploration

## Objective
The objective of Week 2 was to gain familiarity with the Linux command-line interface, explore the filesystem structure, and retrieve basic system information from the Ubuntu Server virtual machine.

---

## Accessing the Server
The Ubuntu Server virtual machine installed in Week 1 was accessed using the local console via VirtualBox. The system was logged into using the configured student user account.

---

## Linux Filesystem Exploration
Basic Linux commands were used to navigate and inspect the filesystem:

- `pwd` was used to display the current working directory  
- `ls` was used to list directory contents  
- `cd` was used to change directories  

The standard Linux directory structure such as `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, and `/usr` was explored to understand their purposes.

---

## System Information Commands
Several system information commands were executed to examine the server status:

- `whoami` – confirmed the currently logged-in user  
- `hostname` – displayed the system hostname  
- `uname -a` – provided kernel and system information  
- `df -h` – displayed disk usage in a human-readable format  
- `free -h` – showed memory usage statistics  

These commands helped verify the correct installation and operation of the Ubuntu Server system.

---

## Evidence
Screenshots of the executed commands and their outputs were captured and stored in the `Week-02/screenshots/` directory as supporting evidence.

---

## Summary
This week provided hands-on experience with the Linux command line and system exploration. The skills developed are essential for system administration tasks and will support more advanced Operating Systems practical work in later weeks.
