# Week 2: Linux Command Line and System Exploration

## Objective
The objective of Week 2 was to gain familiarity with the Linux command-line interface, explore the Linux filesystem, manage users, and retrieve basic system information. These tasks develop foundational skills required for administering and working with Linux-based operating systems.

---

## Accessing the Server
The Ubuntu Server virtual machine installed in Week 1 was accessed using the local console. The system was logged into using a standard user account created during installation.

---

## Linux Filesystem Exploration
Basic Linux commands were used to navigate and inspect the filesystem:
- `pwd` to display the current directory
- `ls` to list directory contents
- `cd` to change directories

The standard Linux directory structure such as `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, and `/usr` was explored to understand their purpose.

---

## User and System Information
System and user-related information was retrieved using:
- `whoami` to identify the current user
- `hostname` to confirm the system name
- `uname -a` to display kernel and system information
- `df -h` to view disk usage
- `free -h` to display memory usage

These commands provide insight into how system resources are managed by the operating system.

---

## Summary
Week 2 demonstrated practical interaction with a Linux operating system using the command line. Understanding filesystem layout, users, and system resources is essential for operating system administration and prepares the environment for more advanced tasks in later weeks.
