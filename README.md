# CMPN202 – Operating Systems Coursework

## Week 1: Virtualisation and Ubuntu Server Installation

### Objective
The objective of Week 1 was to install and configure an Ubuntu Server virtual machine using VirtualBox, gain familiarity with server-based Linux systems, and prepare the environment for later Operating Systems practical work.

---

### Virtualisation Setup
VirtualBox was installed on a Windows 11 host system. A new virtual machine was created with the following configuration:
- Operating System: Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS
- Architecture: 64-bit
- Memory: 2 GB RAM
- Storage: 20 GB virtual disk (VDI)
- Network: Host-only adapter

---

### Ubuntu Server Installation
The Ubuntu Server ISO image was mounted and the installation process was completed successfully. During installation:
- Language and keyboard layout were configured
- Automatic disk partitioning was used
- A user account was created
- OpenSSH server was installed and enabled
- Password authentication over SSH was allowed

---

### Verification
After installation, the system booted successfully into Ubuntu Server. Login was confirmed via the terminal, and the system information was displayed, confirming the installation was successful.

---

### Evidence
Screenshots showing:
- Ubuntu Server login screen
- Successful user login
- System information output

are included in this repository as evidence of completion.

---

### Outcome
Ubuntu Server was successfully installed and configured within a virtualised environment. The system is ready for further Operating Systems practical tasks in subsequent weeks.
